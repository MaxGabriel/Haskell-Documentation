## Documenting Haskell Libraries

1. Pick a project or module that you'd like to work on documenting. I recommend working on a library that you've already used, but you can also look for something in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/MaxGabriel/Haskell-Documentation/issues). If you'd like to work on a tutorial instead, check out requests for tutorials [at this repo](https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hasktuts).
	* Please comment on the issue tracker what you're working on, and if you'd like other people to join you.
2. Find the library on Github and fork it.
3. Clone your copy of the library.
4. Write documentation.
5. Test that it looks correct (see below)
6. Push to your own repo, then submit a pull request to the original library.
